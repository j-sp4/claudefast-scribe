# Sync Watcher

Watches the `server/` directory for changes. When the special file `server/app/api/mcp/route.tsx` changes, it updates `docs/app/architecture/page.tsx` by inserting or refreshing an autogenerated timestamp block.

## Usage

- Install deps (already done in repo):

```bash
cd sync && npm install
```

- Run the watcher:

```bash
npm start
```

The watcher logs events and will update the docs architecture page upon changes to the special file.

## Notes

- This is a demo hardcoded sync. Extend `index.js` to add more rules.
- Requires Node.js >= 18.
